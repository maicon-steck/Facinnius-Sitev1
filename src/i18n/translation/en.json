If you have any questions after reading this Privacy Policy, please contact us. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>What Information We Collect:</strong> </span> </p> <br /> <br /> <p> <span> For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the following definitions apply: We collect all information entered by the User when using the Site, such as, for example, filling out the forms that we make available on the Site, as well as carrying out registrations or any comments. In summary, it is all the information actively made available by the User when using the Site. </span> </p> <br /> <br /> <p> <span> We also automatically collect information when the User accesses the Site, such as device characteristics, browser characteristics, Internet Protocol (IP, with date and time), IP origin, information about clicks, pages accessed, the following pages accessed after leaving the Site, or any search term entered on or in reference to the Site, among others. We may also use other technologies, such as cookies, pixel tags, beacons and local shared objects, to collect User information and improve your browsing experience. </span> </p> <br /> <br /> <p> <span> The User is allowed to block the collection of some types of information, such as cookies. If this configuration is implemented, however, it is possible that some tools or technologies offered by the Site will not work correctly. </span> </p> <br /> <br /> <p> <span> Thus, the User is already aware of the information collected by the Site and expresses free, express and informed consent in relation to the collection of such information. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>2. How we use the collected information</strong> </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> Information collected through the Site will be used to: </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>1.</strong> The provision of products or services ordered on the Site. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>2.</strong> Facilitate the identification of Users' profile and needs, in order to improve the offer of products and/or services. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>3.</strong> Send information about products and/or services of interest to users. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>4.</strong> Announce changes, innovations or promotions about products and services. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>5.</strong> Offer our company's products and services. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> We use interest-based advertising campaign features, remarketing lists, demographic and location targeting information on our Site. Advertising campaigns do not associate individual identifiers with remarketing lists, cookies, feed data or other anonymous identifiers. Likewise, the resources applied in campaigns are not associated with information collected on the page of our website and advertisements. Additionally, personally identifiable information is not shared with any Site or partner via the remarketing tag or any data feed that may be associated with our advertisements.

If you no longer wish to receive advertising newsletters, please send us an email. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> It is also important to note that the Site may contain links to other pages, such as social networks or virtual stores, among others, which have a Privacy Policy with provisions different from those in this document. Thus, it is not responsible for the collection, use, sharing and storage of User data by those responsible for such pages. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>3. Who We Share Collected Information With</strong> </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> We may share the data in reference with the other partnership companies and with third parties in an anonymous way, with which the User expressly agrees from the outset, which may occur especially in the following cases: </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>1.</strong> If the viability of the business and/or services offered depends on the transfer of data to partners. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>2.</strong> For the protection of interests, in any type of conflict, including legal actions, such as, but not limited to, when there is a need to identify or reveal User data that is using the Site for illicit purposes. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>3.</strong> In the case of transactions and corporate changes involving us. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>4.</strong> By court order or by request of administrative authorities that have legal competence for its request. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>4. How we store the collected information</strong> </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> The information collected is treated as confidential, and any employee who comes into contact with it will undertake not to distort their use, as well as not to use them in a way that deviates from the provisions of this Privacy Policy. We use all reasonable efforts in the market to guarantee the security of its systems in the custody of said data. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> In order for such measures to become viable, we take the following precautions: </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>1.</strong> We use standard and market methods to anonymize the collected data. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>2.</strong> We have software to protect against unauthorized access to our systems. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>3.</strong> We only authorize previously established persons to access the places where we store information. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>4.</strong> Those who come into contact with the information must undertake to maintain absolute secrecy. Breach of secrecy will entail civil liability and the person responsible will be prosecuted in accordance with Brazilian law. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> This Privacy Policy represents our efforts to protect the information of Users who access our Site. However, due to the very nature of the Internet, it is not possible to guarantee that malicious third parties will not succeed in improperly accessing the information stored by us. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>5. When We Delete Information</strong> </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> The information referred to in this Privacy Policy will be automatically deleted when it is no longer useful for the purposes for which it was collected. However, if the User wishes to anticipate this exclusion, he may request it via email or telephone. In such circumstances, we will use our best efforts to fulfill all requests in the shortest possible time. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> However, the User must be aware that, even in the event of an exclusion request, we will respect the minimum information storage period determined by Brazilian legislation. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>6. User Responsibilities</strong> </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> The User declares that he is aware, from now on, that it is his sole responsibility: </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> In order for such measures to become viable, we take the following precautions: </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>1.</strong> Enter only truthful information on our website. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>2.</strong> Take care of your individual digital identification data whenever you access the Internet, informing them only in operations where data protection exists. </span> </p> <p> <span> <strong>3.</strong> We only authorize previously established persons to access the places where we store information. </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>7. Updating this Privacy Policy</strong> </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy whenever necessary, in order to provide greater security and convenience to the User. Therefore, it is important that the User read the Privacy Policy each time they access the Site. </span> </p> <br /> <br /> <p> <span> <strong>8. Competent legislation and jurisdiction</strong> </span> </p> <br /> <p> <span> This Privacy Policy will be governed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Federative Republic of Brazil, regardless of the conflicts of these laws with laws of other states or countries, with the jurisdiction of the User's place of residence, in Brazil, to resolve any doubt arising from this instrument. The User expressly consents to the jurisdiction of this court, and hereby waives the jurisdiction of any other jurisdiction, however privileged it may be or become. </span> </p> <br/> ",
